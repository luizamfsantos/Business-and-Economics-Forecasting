# Business and Economics Forecasting

## Goal
My goal with this is to showcase to potential employers some of my work in business and economics forecasting.

## Contents
This repo contains my personal codes and reports submitted to the ECO 4601 class at Texas Tech University during Spring 2020. This material is allowed to be here by Dr. Julian Ludwig from the Economics Department who taught this class during Spring 2020.

The book used in this class is Forecasting for Economics and Business by Gloria Gonzalez-Rivera.
